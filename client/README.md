# Infinite Scroll Client

This is just a test app to play around with infinite scrolling. In order to work it needs the server to be running (check `server/README.md` for more info).

Scroll to the bottom of the page to see more posts being fetched and rendered on the screen.

## How to run

```bash
yarn start
```

or

```bash
nmp start
```
